## Problem Description## Problem Description



Given a text file containing a single character 'H', determine the minimum number of operations to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters using only:Given a text file containing a single character 'H', determine the minimum number of operations to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters using only:

- **Copy All**: Copies all characters currently in the file- **Copy All**: Copies all characters currently in the file

- **Paste**: Pastes the previously copied characters- **Paste**: Pastes the previously copied characters



## Solution## Solution



The solution uses the mathematical insight that this problem is equivalent to finding the **sum of all prime factors** of `n`. This is because the optimal strategy involves factorizing `n` and using the most efficient copying patterns.The solution uses the mathematical insight that this problem is equivalent to finding the **sum of all prime factors** of `n`.

## Implementation## Files Structure



The current implementation in `0-minoperations.py` is streamlined and efficient:```

```python├── 0-minoperations.py     # Main solution with tests

def minOperations(n):├── minoperations.py       # Clean importable version

    if n < 2:├── test_minoperations.py  # Comprehensive test suite

        return 0└── README.md             # Detailed explanation

    ops = 0```

    factor = 2

    while n > 1:## Algorithm Complexity

        while n % factor == 0:

            ops += factor- **Time Complexity**: O(√n) - only checks factors up to √n

            n //= factor- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant space usage

        factor += 1

    return ops## Usage

├── test_minoperations.py  # Comprehensive test suite

└── README.md             # Detailed explanation## Testing

```

The solution has been thoroughly tested with various edge cases and examples, all passing successfully.
## Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(√n) - efficiently finds all prime factors
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant space usage

## Usage

```python
from minimum_operations.minoperations import minOperations

# Example usage
result = minOperations(9)  # Returns 6
print(f"Minimum operations for n=9: {result}")
```

## Key Algorithm Insights

1. **Prime Factorization**: The problem reduces to summing all prime factors of `n`
2. **Optimal Strategy**: For `n = p1^a1 × p2^a2 × ... × pk^ak`, the answer is `a1×p1 + a2×p2 + ... + ak×pk`
3. **Edge Cases**: Returns 0 for `n < 2` since no operations are needed

## Testing

The solution handles all edge cases correctly:
- `n = 1`: 0 operations (already achieved)
- `n = prime`: n operations (copy once, paste n-1 times)
- `n = composite`: Sum of prime factors
